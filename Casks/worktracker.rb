  caveats <<~EOS
    WorkTracker is not notarized by Apple, so macOS quarantines it on install.
    Clear that once, or the app won't open:

      xattr -cr /Applications/WorkTracker.app

    On first launch macOS will ask to allow Automation (to read the frontmost
    app name) and Notifications. Both are optional — time tracking works
    without them.
